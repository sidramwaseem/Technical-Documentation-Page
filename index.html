            Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming
            language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as
            its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
            logical code for small and large-scale projects.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.</li>
            <li>
              It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured
              (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional
              programming.
            </li>
            <li>
              It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to
              its comprehensive standard library.

            Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented
            programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many
            of its features support functional programming and aspect-oriented
            programming (including by metaprogramming and metaobjects (magic
            methods)).Many other paradigms are supported via extensions,
            including design by contract and logic programming.

          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            Variables are containers for storing data values.Python has no
            command for declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment
            you first assign a value to it.
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>x = 5</div>
            <div>y = "John"</div>
            <div>print(x)</div>
            <div>print(y)</div></code
          >
          <p>
            Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and
            can even change type after they have been set.
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>x = 4 # x is of type int</div>
            <div>x = "Sally" # x is now of type str</div>
            <div>print(x)</div>
          </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="strings">
          <header>Strings</header>
          <p>
            Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks,
            or double quotation marks.'hello' is the same as "hello".You can
            display a string literal with the print() function:
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>print("Hello")</div>
            <div>print('Hello')</div>
          </code>
          <p>
            Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name
            followed by an equal sign and the string:
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>a = "Hello"</div>
            <div>print(a)</div>
          </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="numbers">
          <header>Numbers</header>
          <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>int</li>
            <li>float</li>
            <li>complex</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to
            them:
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>x = 1 # int</div>
            <div>y = 2.8 # float</div>
            <div>z = 1j # complex</div>
          </code>
          <p>
            To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>print(type(x))</div>
            <div>print(type(y))</div>
            <div>print(type(z))</div>

        <section class="main-section" id="conditional_statements">
          <header>Conditional Statements</header>
          <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Equals: a == b</li>
            <li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
            <li>Less than: a < b</li>
            <li>Less than or equal to: a <= b</li>
            <li>Greater than: a > b</li>
            <li>Greater than or equal to: a >= b</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if
            statements" and loops. An "if statement" is written by using the if
            keyword.
          </p>
          <code>
            <div>a = 33</div>
            <div>b = 200</div>
            <div>if b > a:</div>

          <header>Indentation</header>
          <p>
            Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line)
            to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use
            curly-brackets for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>If statement, without indentation (will raise an error):</p>
          <code>
            <div>a = 33</div>
            <div>b = 200</div>
            <div>if b > a:</div>
            <div>print("b is greater than a") # you will get an error</div>

          <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</p>
          <p>
            Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store
            collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all
            with different qualities and usage.
          </p>
          <p>Lists are created using square brackets:</p>
          <code>
            <div>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</div>

          <h3>List Items</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
            </li>
            <li>
              List items are indexed, the first item has index <code>[0]</code>,
              the second item has index <code>[1]</code> etc.

          <p>
            The Zen of Python is a collection of 19 "guiding principles" for
            writing computer programs that influence the design of the Python
            programming language.Software engineer Tim Peters wrote this set of
            principles and posted it on the Python mailing list in 1999.Peters's
            list left open a 20th principle "for Guido to fill in", referring to
            Guido van Rossum, the original author of the Python language. The
            vacancy for a 20th principle has not been filled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peters's Zen of Python was included as entry number 20 in the
            language's official Python Enhancement Proposals and was released
            into the public domain.[3] It is also included as an Easter egg in
            the Python interpreter, where it can be displayed by entering
            <code>import this</code>.

            Comments starts with a <code>#</code>, and Python will ignore them:

          <p>
            Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a
            variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your
            code, and place your comment inside it:
          </p>
